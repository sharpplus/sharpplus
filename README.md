## Sharp+ Code

This repository contains the code for "Sharp+: Efficient Aggregation of Zero-Knowledge Range and Multiplication Proofs".

The main experimental results (Tables 1-6) can be reproduced by running the main function in [experiments/FinalExperiments.java](https://github.com/sharpplus/sharpplus/blob/main/src/experiments/FinalExperiments.java)
The tables will be written in the form of LaTeX code to the console.
